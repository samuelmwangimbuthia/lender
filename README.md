## Lender
This project is a platform that brings together lenders and borrowers in a process commonly refered to a financial intermediation.

It allows individual lenders to offer money at their preferred rates of interest.

The market-place feature allows borrowers to compare the various offers and pick the one that most suits their needs.
Lenders will also have access to the credit history of the borrowers put together by the platform.

Through the guarantee feature, the platform will offer custody for collaterals from borrowers. Lenders can inspect the securities offered before advancing the loans.

This platform is a great opportunity for individuals wishing to venture into shylock business and have little capital. It will also bring onboard those already in the business and gives them access to a wider market.
